ACKNOWLEDGEMENT POLICY
======================
Whenever you publish research or present results generated with WHIPS,
please include the following acknowledgement or an appropriate
equivalent:

	We wish to thank the University of Wisconsin--Madison for the 
	use and development of the Wisconsin Horizontal Interpolation
	Program for Satellites (WHIPS).  WHIPS was developed by Jacob
	Oberman, Erica Scotty, Keith Maki and Tracey Holloway, with 
	funding from the NASA Air Quality Applied Science Team 
	(AQAST) and the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium Undergraduate
	Award.


QUICK START
===========


1. Install the program and run the built-in test module to confirm
that it is working properly.  Installation instructions can be found
in the file INSTALL.txt
 

2. Download whatever data you plan to process.  Currently, the program
is designed to process OMI NO2 DOMINO level 2 data, OMI NO2 NASA level
2 data and MOPITT CO data.  See the detailed documentation for the 
--filelist argument for locations of data.


3. Navigate to the folder where whips.py installed or add it to
your path.  It should be the /bin folder corresponding to the /lib 
folder where your python packages live.  Invoke it as:
     
     whips.py --help

4. Follow the on-screen instructions, adding each of the required
parameters.  If you need help with the projection attributes or the
output function attributes, invoke the built-in help as:

     whips.py --AttributeHelp <function_name>

For detailed explanations of all parameters and attributes, see the
"Parameter Details" section below.


5. Invoke whips.py once for each output file you'd like to create.
Note that the software creates output files with only a single
timestep, so you'll need to invoke the command once for each timestep
(IE if you want a month with timesteps every day, you'll probably want
to write a shell script that calls the command once for each day)


6. Additionally, you may create a grid file for your chosen grid by 
including the --includeGrid flag followed by the desired filename.  
A file containing the gridcells used by the projection will be written 
to the same directory as the standard output file.


7. Concatenate your outputs if desired (the authors recommend the NCO
operators at http://nco.sourceforge.net/ if you're using a netCDF
output format) and carry on!  


INVOKING WHIPS - METHOD 1
============================================
Calling directly from the command line
--------------------------------------------

There are two primary methods of running whips.  The first method
is to give whips all the information and settings it needs as flags
in a single command line call.  The calls become very long; typing
them in by hand is therefore inadvisible.  The script can easily
be batch run by building the call in a script.

For clarity and readability, line continuation characters are used to
place each attribute on a separate line.  It is not required to break
up attributes like this, but the command line needs to see the
invocation as a single command, so if you want to break it onto
multple lines you must use line-continuation characters.

1A. Process MOPITT level 2 CO data, (Version 5) 
----------------------------------------------

     - Uses a 36km lambert conic conformal grid centered over North
     America
     - Writes out a 2D, 3D, and 4D parameter from the file

INVOKING WHIPS - METHOD 2
============================================
Using a formatted input file
--------------------------------------------

The second method of running WHIPS is to specify all the options
and information it needs in a specially-formatted input file.  The
command line call then consists only of specifying the location of
the input file WHIPS should read from.  

Below is an explanatory example of the format:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FAKE INPUT FILE

BEGIN

. This line begins with a period.  That means it is a comment
. Comments will be ignored by WHIPS when processing the file

. All required flags must be specified with the flag name
. and the desired value.  These flags must be in capital case.
. All possible flags (including optional flags) shown below:

DIRECTORY = /where/you/had/your/input/files
FILETYPE = some_file_type
GRIDPROJ = some_grid_projection
MAPFUNC = some_map_function
OUTDIRECTORY = /where/you/want/output/files
OUTFILENAME = name_of_output_file
VERBOSE = True_or_False
INTERACTIVE = True_or_False
OUTFUNC = some_output_function
INCLUDEGRID = /absolute/path/to/output/file/for/grid

. FILELIST is delimited by spaces.  Leave out to use all files
. in DIRECTORY
FILELIST = list of files

. Projection and output function attributes are specified
. the same as flags.  Just as with the command line call, 
. the correct attributes must be present or the program
. will exit.

stdPar1 = 33

inFieldNames = ColumnAmountNO2Trop,Time

. Note that unlike with the command line call, quotations are
. not needed when whitespace is part of an attribute value

outUnits = Molecules cm^-2,seconds since epoch

. You can specify parameters in any order. This includes 
. intermixing attributes and flags

time = Time
OUTFILENAME = whatever_we_want

. WHIPS input files must begin with BEGIN and end with END

END

above in the section on method 1.

PARAMETER DETAILS
=================

Each input attribute is explained here.  Note that each output
function has a separate set of required inputs and that the
--outFuncAttrs is therefore broken down by output function.  Make sure
you're referencing the details for the attributes relevant to the
function you want to use.  

  --help
	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- Display the onscreen help message and exit the program.

  --inFromFile /complete/path/to/input_file.txt
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- An input file specifying the input options and information
	  for WHIPS.  The input file is an alternate interface - 
	  everything that can be done with a command line call can
	  also be done by specifying the input file and calling the
	  input file using this flag.
	- The input file syntax rules are as follows.

	    1) The file must have "BEGIN" at the top before specifying
	       anything else.  Anything above the BEGIN line will be
	       ignored.
	    2) Comments are denoted by putting "." at the beginning of
	       a line.  Comments are ignored when the input file is 
	       parsed.
	    3) All required flags must be included.  Values are assigned
	       using the following syntax:
	           FOO = bar
	       All flags must be in caps case.  Optional flags may
	       be specified in this fashion as well. 
	    4) All attributes for the projection, map and possibly
	       parser (right now only MOPITT requires parser attributes)
	       must be specified in the same syntax used for flags. 
	       Case-sensitive, so the case of the attribute names must
	       exactly match that specified below

	See above for both an illustrative example input file as well
	as complete input files for the test cases. 

  --directory /path/to/input/directory
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: the current working directory at time of invocation  	      
  	- The input directory that the program will search for whatever
  	  input files are specified.  If those files are not found in
  	  this directory, the programs behavior is governed by the
  	  value of the --interactive flag

  --fileList file1 [file2] [file3] ...
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: The list of all files in --directory (non-recursive)
	- The list of files that the program should attempt to
  	  process for output.  Most output functions (with the 
	  exception of the function designed for MOPITT CO) are
  	  designed to accept an arbitrary number of inputs and only
  	  use that data which fits the requirements.  
	- filtering out files a priori which cannot contain the
   	  information required, for instance files known to be on the
	  wrong date, saves computational power.  It is advisable to
	  use this parameter to include only those files which may
          contain the desired information wherever possible.

	- The type of file we're attempting to read in.  Must be one
  	  of the options listed above.
	- Filetypes have two primary roles.  The first is to specify
	  the correct parser so that the file may be read by the
	  program.  The second is to provide default values for the
	  attributes of the output function.
	- Each filetype has a default output function considered most 
	  appropriate for that filetype.  Default attributes specified
	  will generally be targeted at this particular output function.
	  The default output function can always be overridden with 
	  the --outFunc flag.
	- Each parser has an associated filetype that ends in "_generic"
	  These filetypes still specify a default output function but do
	  not provide default values for any of the output function 
	  parameters.
	- Some filetypes require additional "parser parameters".  These 
	  can be passed in at the command line under the --projAttrs flag
	  and should be formatted just like any projection attribute
	  or output function attribute if using an input text file.

  	options.  Further details on these options are as follows:
 	
		latlon   - The Plate Caree projection, also known as
		       	 the "unprojected" projection.  x and y are

			  	 (longitude) direction.  In degrees.
			  yCell  - The size of a gridcell in the y
				 (latitude) direction.  In degrees.

		         transformed and scaled, then mapped to
		         latitude and longitude via the projection.
		         The projection parameters must be accurate to
		         get the correct output grid.  All required
		         parameters are available in the GRIDDESC file
		         associated with the MM3 modeling system. A
		         description of the GRIDDESC format can be
		         found at
		         http://www.baronams.com/products/ioapi/GRIDDESC.html

			 REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
			 stdPar1 - One of the 2 standard parallels
			  	   used	to define the Lambert Conic
			   	   Conformal projection.  Must be a
				   valid latitude, in degrees.
		 	 stdPar2 - The second standard parallel used
			 	   to define the Lambert Conic
				   Conformal projection.  Set this
			 	   equal to the same value as stdPar1 
				   if the single-parallel form of the
				   projection is being used. Must be a
				   valid latitude in degrees.
			 refLat	 - The reference latitude upon which
			 	   the projection is centered. This is
			 	   the YCENT value in the GRIDDESC
				   file. In degrees
			 refLon  - The reference longitude upon which
			 	   the  projection is centered.  This
				   is BOTH the XCENT and PROJ_GAMMA
			 	   values in the GRIDDESC file.  If
			 	   these values are not identical, do
			 	   not use this function. In degrees.
			 xOrig	 - The location of the origin in
			 	   projected x coordinates.  This
			 	   is the XORIG value in the GRIDDESC
			 	   file. In same units as earthRadius.
			 yOrig	 - The location of the origin in
			 	   projected y coordinates.  This
			 	   is the YORIG value in the GRIDDESC
			 	   file. In same units as earthRadius.
			 xCell	 - The x dimension of a cell, in
			 	   projected coordinates.  In the same
			 	   units as earthRadius.  This is the
			 	   XCELL value in the GRIDDESC file
			 yCell	 - The y dimension of a cell, in
			 	   projected coordinates.  In the same
			 	   units as earthRadius.  This is the
			 	   YCELL value in the GRIDDESC file
			 nRows	 - The number of rows in the grid.
			 nCols   - The number of columns in the grid.
			 earthRadius - The assumed radius of the Earth
			 	   (assumed spherical).  Must match
				   units used for xCell and yCell.

  --projAttrs name1:value1 name2:value2 ...
	REQUIRED: YES
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- The attributes required for the chosen projection.  Must
	  have all the required attributes for that projection.  The
	  required parameters for each projection are listed under
          that projection's name above.
	- Case-sensitive.  Attribute names must EXACTLY match those
	  laid out above.

  --mapFunc {point_in_cell, regional_intersect, global_intersect}
  	REQUIRED: YES
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- The mapping function that will be used to assign pixels to
  	  cell(s).  Certain datasets have restrictions on which
	  mapping functions are usable.
	- Also responsible for computing the "geometric weight" of
  	  pixels.  That is, this function computes the weight unique
	  to a cell/pixel combination.  At present, neither of the
	  functions provide this functionality.
	        
		point_in_cell - Maps pixels defined by a single
			lat/lon (usually the cell center) to whatever
			grid cell that point lies inside in projected
			space.  This assigns each pixel to a unique
			grid cell.  Grid cells are open on the top and
			right sides and closed on the left and lower
			sides (with directions defined according to
			the projected coordinate system).  This
			function is supported by all currently
			available input filetypes.  NOTE: for 
			filetypes where regional_intersect is 
			available it is strongly recommended to use
			regional_intersect over point_in_cell.

		regional_intersect - Maps pixels (as defined by 
			pairs of geocoordinates that nominally
			correspond to pixel corners) to ALL gridcells
			intersected.  No geometric weights are
			calculated.  This function is currently
			supported by HDFnasaomil2 and HDFknmiomil2
			filetypes only.  

			NOTE: regional intersect should NOT be
			used for grids that wrap all the way 
			around the world longitudinally (IE the
			east and west edges are the same meridian).
			Such grids may give unexpected results, 
			especially if any pixels span the
			discontinuity.

			Pixels with one ore more vertices with
			fill values coordinates are rejected

			Makes several assumptions:
			  - Polar discontinuities not encountered
			  - Projection is NOT global
			  - grid is rectilinear in projected space.
			  - Pixels are convex polygons.

	        global_intersect - Maps pixels (as defined by
	      	        n pairs of geocoordinates that nominally
			correspond to the n corners of the 
			pixel) to ALL gridcells intersected.
			No geometric weights are calculated.
			
			This is roughly the same as 
			the regional_intersect approach
			save that it is slightly slower and 
			assumes that the grid wraps around the 
			world longitudinally. 

			Pixels with one ore more vertices with
			fill values coordinates are rejected

			NOTE: using this function with
			grids where the east and west boundary
			are NOT the same meridian is not
			supported and may lead to unexpected
			results.

			Makes several assumptions:
			  - polar discontinuities not encountered
			  - Projection is global and cyclizes
			    along the east and west edges
			  - grid is rectilinear in projected space
			  - Pixels are convex polygons
		
  --outFunc {OMNO2e_netCDF_avg,unweighted_filtered_MOPITT_avg_netCDF}
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: Depends on the value chose for --filetype
	- The function that computes the output and writes the output
  	  file.  Functions are given significant freedom, but all
	  current functions take some kind of average and write it to
  	  an output file.
	- These functions are frequently designed around a particular
  	  instrument or input format.  Efforts are made to make them
  	  as general as possible, but specialized output functions are
	  only guaranteed (and really should only be used) for the
	  parser types for which they have been designed.  To this 
	  end, the associated function will be chosen by default for 
	  all filetypes, though it can always be overridden with this 
	  command.
	- See the documentaiton for the --filetypes flag to see what
	  the default output function for each filetype is.
	- In all cases where a fieldname must be given for a
   	  parameter it is the short name (the name used to access the
  	  field through the parser) that must be given.  The 
	  fieldnames must correspond to the official field names 
          in the data file.  These can usually be found in the data
	  documentation.  Documentation for a few commonly processed
	  formats can be found at:
		OMI (KNMI) - <http://www.temis.nl/docs/OMI_NO2_HE5_1.0.2.pdf>
		OMI (NASA) - <http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi/no2/OMNO2_data_product_specification.pdf>
		MOPITT - <http://www.acd.ucar.edu/mopitt/v5_users_guide_beta.pdf>

	     	 OMNO2e_netCDF_avg - Averaging algorithm based on the
		 	NASA OMI level 2 to level 3 processing
		 	algorithm.  Designed for the OMI level 2
		 	filetypes (HDFnasaomil2 and HDFknmiomil2) and 
			is the default for those filetypes use with 
			other filetypes is of questionable utility.  

			Outputs results to a netCDF file.
			
			Further details available in the
		 	official NASA documentation located at 
			<http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omno2e_v003.shtml>
			
			Assumptions:
			  - Data is at most 3 dimensional.
			  - Invalid pixels are marked with an overall
		 	  quality flag.
			  - Timestamps are in the TAI93 format.

		 unweighted_filtered_MOPITT_avg_netCDF - Averaging
		 	algorithm based on the NASA algorithm for
		 	processing level 2 MOPITT CO data to level 3
		 	MOPITT CO data.  Designed for the MOPITT level
		 	2 filetypes (HDFmopittl2 only at present) and 
			is the default for that filetype. Use with 
			other filetypes is discouraged.
			
			Outputs results to a netCDF file.

			IMPORTANT: Only 1 input file may be used with
			this function.  Conveniently, NASA currently
			provides data in 1-day granules.

			Further details available in the official NASA
			documentation:
			
			Deeter, Merritt N (2009). MOPITT (Measurements
			    of Pollution in the Troposphere) Validated
			    Version 4 Product Users Guide.  Available from
			    <http://www.acd.ucar.edu/mopitt/products.shtml>

			Assumptions/caveats:
			  - All fields are filtered based on the
			  number of valid layers present in the
			  specified column field.  Including 2D
			  fields.
			  - Timestamps are in the TAI93 format.



  --outFuncAttrs name1:value1 name2:value2
  	REQUIRED: YES
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- The attributes required for the chosen output function 
	  specified somehow.  Can be either supplied by the filetype
	  or specified by the user.  When the user and filetype both
	  supply output function attributes, the filetype takes 
	  precedence.  The "_generic" filetypes are supplied to
	  allow complete control of all output function attributes
	  if desired.
	- To see which attributes are supplied by which filetypes,
	  see the documentation for the --filetype flag above
	- If one of the "value" elements contains whitespace, enclose
	  the entire name:value pair in double quotes.  For example:
	      the:full_monty  	     <- okay
	      "the:full monty" 	     <- okay
	      the:full monty	     <- not okay
	- In many cases, a comma delimited list is requested.  Make
	  sure that elements of the list are not separated by spaces.
	  For example:
	      pythons:EricIdle,JohnCleese	<- okay
	      pythons:EricIdle, JohnCleese	<- not okay
	      "pythons:Eric Idle,John Cleese"	<- okay
	      "pythons:Eric Idle, John Cleese"	<- not okay
	- Case-sensitive.  Attribute names must EXACTLY match those
	  laid out below.
	- Below are the required parameters for each existing output
	  function.  { } contain usable/recommended parameters for

	  versions of the data at the time of writing and should be
	  double-checked:

			dimLabels - List of names of the extra
				dimensions in the output file.  Must
				be a forward-slash-delimited list of

				there are four inFields, the first
				and third of which have no extra
				dimensions, the second of which has
				one ("foo"), and the fourth has two
				("foo" and "bar"), the dimLabels
				entry should look like this:
				    /foo//foo,bar
				The outer (slash-delimited) list
				must be	co-indexed to inFieldNames.
			dimSizes - List of the sizes of the extra
				dimensions in the output file.  Must
				be a forward-slash-delimited list of

  --outDirectory /path/to/output/directory
  	REQUIRED: YES
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- The output directory to which the output file(s) should be
	  written.  Make sure that you have write permissions to this
	  directory (the program will complain and quit out if you do
  	  not).

  --outFileName FileName
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: output1
	- The name of the output file itself.  User is responsible for
	  adding any file extensions here (IE .nc if it's a netCDF,
	  .txt if it's an ASCII).  Output will be written in
	  outDirectory under this name.

  --includeGrid GridFileName
        REQUIRED: NO
        DEFAULT: N/A
        - Supply this flag along with the absolute path to a filename
          to which to write out the latitudes and longitudes of the gridcells
          defined by the selected projection.

  --verbose {True,False}
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: True
	- Determines how much command-line output the software
	  provides while running.  The default behavior (--verbose
	  True) provide command line updates for most major
	  subprocesses inside the software.  Setting "False" here will
	  cause the software to be completely silent while running.

  --interactive {True,False}
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: False
	- Determines how the program will handle invalid/nonexistent
	  files.  Under the default behavior (--interactive False)
	  the software will automatically ignore any file it can't
	  process and continue processing any other files in
	  --fileList.  If set to True, exectuion will be suspended and
	  the user will be given several options when an invalid file
	  is encountered.

  --AttributeHelp ProjectionName/OutputFunctionName/FileType [...]
  	REQUIRED: NO
	DEFAULT: N/A
	- Prints a message explaining the required attributes for a
	  given output function or projection and then exits the
	  program.
	- Inputting a filetype outputs the required attributes for
	  the default output function associated with that filetype.
