'''
List of supported filetypes and associated parameters

Each class in this file has, at minimum, an attribute "parser"
that specifies the associated parser for that class.  Each class
may also contain any other variables that will be used for
output function attributes if the output function accepts those
attributes

In some cases, output function attributes may consist of lists
associated with field names for that particular filetype.  In 
these cases, the variables for these attributes will be 
dictionaries keyed off the field name strings.
